# Project Brief: Graphon

Graphon is a hybrid "Work OS" that combines local-first privacy with real-time team collaboration. It aims to bridge the gap between structured knowledge management (like Notion) and real-time communication (like Slack).

## Core Goals
- **Local-First Privacy**: Provide a private, offline-first knowledge base using Markdown and SQLite.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Enable cloud-based teamspaces with chat and Kanban boards using Supabase.
- **Unified Experience**: A "Gateway" launchpad that routes users to either local or team environments seamlessly.
- **Open Core Model**: Maintain an open-source core while allowing for proprietary team features.

## Key Features
- Modern, Apple-inspired design with glassmorphism.
- Notion-style rich text editor (Tiptap).
- Interactive graph visualization of notes.
- Full-text search (FTS5).
- Integrated task management and calendar.
- Cross-platform desktop support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
