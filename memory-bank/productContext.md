# Product Context: Graphon

## Why Graphon exists?
Users often have to choose between powerful, local-first note-taking apps (which lack collaboration) and cloud-first collaboration tools (which lack privacy and offline capabilities). Graphon solves this by providing a dual-mode architecture.

## Problems it Solves
- **Privacy vs. Collaboration**: Users can keep personal notes in a local vault while collaborating with teams in a secure cloud environment.
- **Information Silos**: By combining notes, tasks, calendar, and chat, it reduces the need to switch between multiple apps.
- **Complexity**: Provides a modern, minimalist UI that follows familiar design patterns (Apple-inspired) to reduce cognitive load.

## User Experience Goals
- **Speed**: Instant local search and smooth transitions.
- **Aesthetics**: Premium feel with glassmorphism and system-native styling.
- **Flexibility**: Slash commands and floating toolbars for efficient editing.
